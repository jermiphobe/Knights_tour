# Knights_tour

[Knights Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour)

This started out as a simple program to visualize a knight's tour solution.  It was a simple program where it would run once recursively, then you'd have to restart the whole thing.  I wanted to make it more interactvie and add a menu for 'replayability'.  This meant that I had to rewrite the main algorithm to work in a loop because recursion didn't work nicely with Java Swing...  But it was okay.
